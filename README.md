# Machine Learning

## Gutenberg_project 

* Extracting a custom features to build a text classifier using a subset of Gutenberg corpus.
* The corpus is highly imbalanced where 90% of the corpus is covered by 2 classes and rest of the data by other 7 classes. Due to this imbalance, most of the models fail to correctly classify the books and hence extracting custom features is necessary. Large feature space, and closely related genre sharing similar feature space add to the complexity of the learning problem.
* Libraries used: Scikit-learn, nltk, gensim

## Other files are small scripts with various ML models implemented on various datasets using libraries such as Scikit-learn and SCIPy
